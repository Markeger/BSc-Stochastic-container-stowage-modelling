Here you will find ann file regarding the deterministic solution to container stowage.
the models we have create are based on the PHD project by Dario Pacino in 2011, Fast generation of near-optimal plans for eco-efficient stowage of large container vessels. A link can be found at the bottom.
The data provided used for the deterministic calculation can be found her: https://github.com/maritimelab/StowagePlanning_MasterPlanning_Benchmark
In the depository you will also find an instance reader, and a detailed description of the data.
